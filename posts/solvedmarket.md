Even the author, Gregory Zuckerman, was doubtful at first refusing to cash his advance until he believed the project was viable [2]. Gregory Zuckerman is a highly acclaimed journalist at the Wall Street Journal and author of other classics like ‘ The Greatest Trade Eve r’ and ‘ The Frackers ’. In this book, he turns his attention to Jim Simons, the mathematician, billionaire hedge fund manager, and philanthropist. Simons was the founder of Renaissance Technologies and architect of the Medallion Fund, the best performing fund in modern financial history. Not surprisingly Simons and Renaissance staff are renowned for their secrecy and very little has leaked out of the organisation over the past 30 years

However, many of the leading characters are approaching their later life and Zuckerman eventually persuaded many to contribute to an accurate account of Renaissance’s history for the record. The result is a fascinating read balancing the human story of the people involved whilst dropping tantalising hints as to how the Medallion Fund performed so spectacularly. He chronicles Jim’s career graduating from MIT, a PhD from Berkeley, a stint breaking codes for the IDA before teaching at MIT, at Harvard and eventually heading up the math department at Stony Brook University.

In 1978 Jim left academia to start Monemetrics and trade currencies. He struggled for 10 years and wasn’t going anywhere until he hired Elwyn Berlekamp, a professor of mathematics at Berkeley. Berlekamp rewrote the algorithms to trade short term patterns with sizing based on the opportunity. These changes delivered the first real success for the firm. In 1990, in its third year of operation, the Medallion fund achieved a 59% return. In 1993 he hired Bob Mercer and Peter Brown who were working on speech recognition and machine translation at IBM research. This partnership proved enduring and highly successful as they cracked the equities market and allowed the Medallion fund to scale to thousands of assets.

Jim was 50 before he had any success with Renaissance and 60 before managing to attract significant investment in the fund. His story is a lesson in resilience, persistence and self-belief. A classic illustration of how difficult it is to run a successful quant fund.

## Performance

###### Figure 1: (a) the annual profit in comparison with the size of the fund. In most years, the profit is a significant fraction of the fund whilst in 2000, 2007 and 2008, the returns exceeded 100%. (b) The cumulative profit of the fund. The average fund size was $5.4 billion and was capped at $10 billion in later years. “There is beauty in things that work really well” — Jim Simons

The performance of Renaissance Technologies Medallion Fund is one of the wonders of the modern financial world. It is the technological equivalent of a licence to print money. For 30 years from 1988, the Medallion Fund averaged returns of 66% per annum . It has generated over $100 billion in profits despite the average fund size being a mere $4.5 billion. In itself, this performance is remarkable. What is even more astonishing is that 30 years is a long time for competitors to catch up. But they have not. They haven’t even come close.

Over the same period, the S&P 500 Index has gained 5.1% per annum. 90% of funds fail to match this modest index [3] — let alone reach the dizzy heights of Medallion. After a patchy couple of year at the start, the worst performing year was 1997 with a return of 32% . The best year was during the financial crisis of 2008 when Medallion achieved a return of 152% . Over the last 10 years up to 2018, Medallion has performed even better with average returns of 80% per annum .

## Data

_**“Renaissance had better data, older data, more sophisticated data and were better at dealing with it than anyone else” — Zuckerman**_

There are more factors that influence the market than we, as simple humans, are aware of. Statistical techniques can identify subtle and high-dimensional causal relationships between influential factors and inefficiencies in the market. Since the early days, Renaissance has been collecting and curating vast data archives of everything from economic metrics to the weather. The quantity and quality of this data are key in enabling the algorithms to discover subtle and undiscovered predictors of market patterns. Renaissance simply has better, older and more sophisticated data to drive their systems than their competitors. Boring but important!

## Machine Learning

_**“We’re right 50.75% of the time . . . but we’re 100% right 50.75% of the time. You can make billions that way.” — Bob Mercer**_

The fund took off when equities were introduced into the mix. Initially, the focus was on bonds, commodities and currencies. However, for the fund to grow, many more assets were required. Equities had proven difficult for the Renaissance quants to crack and early efforts were disappointing. With the addition of Mercer and Brown to the team, a brand new system was coded which was essentially a sophisticated version of statistical arbitrage. Subtle relationships between stocks were identified and the information used to predict future bias in the price movement. According to Zuckerman, this allowed them to correctly predict the direction of medium-term trades 50.75% of the time.
