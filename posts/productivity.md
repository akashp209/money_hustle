###### How to manage your time for maximum productivity

Every moment of your time is important. As Steve Rousseau puts it in his article on dopamine fasting , your time is now monetized very heavily. Every second is an opportunity for someone to make money from your time, or for you to make money from someone else’s.

Although he is discussing our devices when he says this, I think the important thing to note is the idea that we see our time as being very valuable, not just because we don’t have much of it, but because now more than ever it seems to have an increased monetary value as well.

Advertising and marketing are ubiquitous in every walk of life. This means we are constantly bombarded by people and companies trying to make money from our time. Whatever your view may be on this, it means that it is important for us to become aware of just how much value our time has for other people, and more importantly for ourselves.

I have spent a lot of time over the last few years trying to find ways to extract more value out of my time, but most of the methods I tried seem to do this in a localised — rather than a globalised — fashion. For example, getting up early to have more time in the morning to do more productive things is great, for a few hours .

I then seem to repay my energy debt later on in the day, and so the benefits are almost cancelled out. As streamlined tasks in the morning are nullified by the fact that I am struggling to keep my eyes open in the middle of the afternoon, it seems I am fighting a battle I cannot win.

Thus, it is not quite as simple as applying a single action or method to squeeze more time into the day, as I had been doing. Instead, many smaller actions need to be taken to maximise the amount of time I have, and then to make the probability of that time being productive much higher.

Unfortunately, unless you are a highly regimented person it can be very difficult to consistently get the most out of your time throughout the day. We have devices that are constantly sapping our energy and distracting us from what we are trying to do. We also have thousands of other thoughts doing the same thing.

So, instead of just trying to show you how to increase the number of productive hours you have each day, this article will try to teach you a few ways that you can increase the chances of each day being productive as a whole.

Then, you can do what I found to be very difficult; you can globalise the effects of higher productivity. Over the course of the day, you will get more done, even if at certain hours of the day it seems a little harder to find focus.

So, let’s do it.

# 1. Work on the beginning and the end of the day

As I said earlier, the common approach to gaining more time is to sacrifice the time spent in bed. But we forget that just getting up early cuts out vital components of sleep.

Due to the nature of sleep itself, we often end up starving our brains of very useful REM sleep. You can find out more about this by Googling it, but Matthew Walker’s Why We Sleep does a great job of explaining the importance of each part of our sleep cycle in more detail.

So, instead of just getting up early, most people also try to extend the start of the sleeping pattern. Go to bed early, get up early. Recipe for success, right ?

Of course, it can be, but the chances are if you are looking for ways to get more out of your day, you have tried this already, and it hasn’t quite worked.

This is because it is not as simple as going to bed early and getting up early. You need to work on it until you can actually do both parts effectively.

Before bed, you need to create a routine that sends you towards sleep. This can involve dimming the lights in the room and dimming the brightness on your devices. You should also try to stay away from your devices for 30–60 minutes before you head to bed. This will help your mind get ready for sleep, and although it might be hard at first, it really can make it much easier to drift off.

A lot of people will tell you to stay away from your phone for an hour before bed, with no exceptions. But in practice this is much easier said than done.

You might think of something to note down in your phone, or you might have a thought you want to share with someone over text before you forget.

This is why it is best to just try and limit how much you use your devices before bed , but don’t worry about eliminating them altogether, as you will probably just feel guilty when you inevitably need to use one of them. A good way to train yourself out of this is to keep a pen and notepad near your bed, so that you can easily write down any pre-sleep thoughts and ideas.

You basically want to quiet your mind before you go to sleep. This can usually just be achieved by limiting your time on your devices. However, taking action such as reading a book before bed or meditating can also work very well. This will make the first leg much easier, and then it is all about the other end of the sleep cycle.

Setting an alarm for a reasonable time, without pushing it too much, will allow your body to adapt to getting up slightly earlier. Perhaps place the alarm at the other side of the room, with a gentle tone, so that you need to get up and out of bed to turn it off.

Try and do some quick exercises to wake your body up. Some star jumps or push ups will do, anything that gets the blood flowing.

This can be thought of as the opposite to the quieting of the mind before bed. In the morning, you want to gently wake it back up, preparing it for the day ahead.

Then, have a stable breakfast routine. I know many will opt to skip it, but I am an advocate of it being the most important meal of the day. I personally cannot go without eating something for more than an hour after I wake up without feeling very hungry, and sometimes even weak if I am doing something physically demanding.

Get into the habit of making breakfast a time to look forward to, and it will be much easier to get out of bed in the morning. Making it easier to both go to bed and get out of it is the key thing to do here, rather than simply tossing and turning and hitting the snooze button, only to say that it’s far too difficult to get up early.

Over time, you will find extra minutes before bed and in the morning to get more done. Just 15 minutes extra either side gives you an extra half hour of time to spend doing the things you want (or need) to do. You will also begin to feel less tired when you get up, which **increases the probability of this extra time being productive .**

# 2. Manage your distractions


Now that you have an extra bit of time in the day, how do you ensure that you make the most of it? By eliminating distractions of course! Put your phone in another room, turn off the TV and focus on your work.

But this once again is the wrong approach. You need to manage your distractions, rather than eliminate them completely. The main reason being that it is simply too hard for most people to do the latter. You want to get to the point where you can have your phone on your desk without being tempted to touch it too often.

The best thing you can do is to put it on silent or do not disturb. This means you can still have it near you without it interrupting your workflow too often. I know that having my phone near me while I work is key, as it allows me to quickly communicate with clients, check things on Google and, perhaps most importantly, control the music in the room!

I like to have some background music, usually instrumentals or something from a chill beats playlist. I find that it distracts the right parts of my brain to allow the other parts to get to work (not the most scientifically accurate statement I will make, I know, but it works for me!).

So, if you don’t already do this, perhaps give it a try, and swap your the pop songs for some without lyrics. I guarantee you will find it easier to focus without trying to subconsciously sing along to your favourite songs.

But there are plenty of other distractions you might worry about too. Your desk will have stationary on it that you can fidget with, and even a pen can become mesmerizing when you are trying to put off an important task. Thus, you need to learn to manage how you react to these distractions and understand that they are inevitable.

Instead, try to focus on your work for a set amount of time. This could be 5, 10 or 20 minutes or more. Then, in between these bursts of work, allow yourself to become distracted. Preferably only briefly, as you don’t want to make it impossible to get back to work. Over time the working stints will get longer, and the distractions will become less powerful.

Try to only check your phone once every hour if that is the main distraction. As you did with your alarm, put it at the other side of the room. Make it a bit harder for yourself to become distracted. But don’t try to eliminate them altogether, as you will just find other things to distract you instead.

# 3. Evaluate what productivity means for you

Finally, you also need to think about what it means to be productive. This will be totally dependent on your own ideals, and it will vary from person to person. You might think that 6 hours of work is enough, while others may think they need to do 10 in order to feel they have been productive.

But it is not just about time spent working; it is also about results. As a freelance writer, I find myself calculating hourly rates from word counts and time spent at my desk. All this tends to do is make it seem like I am working for someone totally different every day, with my hourly wage changing with each different task.

Instead of doing this, I have found that it is better to measure my productivity in different ways, depending on what I am doing. For some tasks, simply getting the work completed within a certain amount of time is the best way to measure it. For others, it is a specific number of words per hour. For other tasks it might have nothing to do with length or duration, but instead about the quality of work that I think I have produced.

You will have your own ways of measuring productivity , and it is key that you do. Otherwise, you will start working to other people’s measurements. You might then end up thinking you are never doing enough, getting yourself down about it. Or you might think you are doing far more than you need to and you can become complacent.

Finding your own definition of a productive day will allow you to set sensible goals for yourself, and to effectively gauge your progress.

# Management over control

Finding your focus and getting the most out of your time is not an easy thing to do. We are surrounded by distractions, and people telling us how we should be doing things in order to get the most value out of our time each day. But this is the wrong way to approach it.

We need to instead increase the odds of us having a productive day by our own standards, and this usually involves managing things rather than controlling them outright .

So, try and manage your life in your own ways and find what works for you, so that you can increase the chances of you having a productive day, every day.
