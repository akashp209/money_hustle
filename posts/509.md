With a net worth of $82.5 billion in 2019, Warren Buffett is the third richest person on the planet.

At 88, he is heralded as one of the most iconic investors of our time. His company, Berkshire Hathaway, owns subsidiaries including Geico, Heinz, and Dairy Queen. To own one share in Berkshire Hathaway, at the time of this writing, you would need over $300,000 — more than the median price of a home in the US in 2019.

Buffett’s wealth is well-chronicled and you can find hundreds of articles that analyze his decisions and habits that got him there, but only a few articles mention the book that first inspired Warren Buffet when he was seven years old.
In the recent HBO documentary Becoming Warren Buffett, the investor described his experience reading the special book:

> **“Very early, probably when I was seven or so, I took this book out of the Benson Library called ‘One Thousand Ways to Make $1,000.’”**

## First, there are a few things you need to know about this book.

One Thousand Ways to Make $1,000 is 509 pages.

It was published in 1936 and is now technically out of print.

It has 13 chapters, each one covering subjects like how to start a business, how to invent things, how to promote your services, and even how to raise things to sell, like fish and turkeys — which is telling of the book’s age.
The book’s author, F.C. Minaker, is uncannily absent from the web. I couldn’t find anything online about the person.

Also, it’s important to note that while a thousand dollars might not seem like much money today, in 1936, a thousand dollars has the equivalent purchasing power of $18,065.24 in 2018, due to inflation.
One Thousand Ways contains vignettes of regular folks and tells the stories how they took a risk, started a business, and reached their first $1,000 in sales — and beyond.
A few examples of the hundreds of stories include John H. Patterson’s National Cash Register company, the advent of J.C. Penney stores, Otto Schnering’s invention of the Baby Ruth chocolate bar, and Mrs. McDougall’s million-dollar tea room restaurants.

## In the documentary, Buffett mentions one specific story in the book that stood out to him:

> “One of the ways, in this book, was having penny-weighing machines. And I sat and calculated how much it would cost to buy the first weighing machine and then how long it would take for the profit of that one to buy another one. I would sit there and create these compound interest tables to figure out how to have a weighing machine for every person in the world.”

This prospect of a penny-weighing machine business “captivated” Buffett, Financial Times writes.

> “The weighing machine was easy to understand,” said Buffett. “I’d buy a weighing machine and use the profits to buy more weighing machines. Pretty soon I’d have twenty weighing machines, and everybody would weigh themselves 50 times a day. I thought, that’s where the money is. The compounding of it — what could be better than that?”

The story is found on page 316 of the book — “Penny-Weight” Scales Lure Pennies.

## The summary of Buffett’s favorite story from “One Thousand Ways to Make $1,000”

In 1933, a fellow named Harry Larson was at a drug store buying a pack of cigarettes and while he stood at the checkout counter, he watched seven people step on an attractive weight scale machine, deposit a penny in the slot, and weigh themselves.

He turned to the druggist behind the counter and asked, “How much money does the scale make each month?”

The druggist said about $20 a month, but he didn’t own it. He said he keeps 75 percent of the earnings while the operator of the machine takes a 25 percent cut.

Harry Larson contacted the manufacturer and asked for full details about becoming an operator. He bought his first three machines using his savings and used the money from those machines to build an empire.

“I bought 70 machines altogether,” he said. “The other 67 were paid out of the pennies taken from the first three. These first three machines cost me $175 and paid me a profit every month of $98. That was a pretty good return on the investment. I found that there is no servicing needed for these machines and nothing to adjust.”


### You can begin to see what intrigued Buffett about this story.

> “You just pick a good location, set them up, and there they are all ready to lure pennies from the curious,” Larson continued. “It’s a clean, simple proposition, and you can’t hit upon a surer or better way of making money easily.

## Making $200,000 per year passively

“After buying the first three scales, I established a line of credit with the manufacturer, and got five more on [a] time-payment plan. My monthly income for the 70 machines amounted to $768, a little better than $10 each. In nine months, I’ve earned enough to pay for the scales, and made a good living besides.”
Accounting for inflation, $768 per month in 1930 would be $15,132.14 per month in 2019 dollars. That’s an income of nearly $200,000 a year.
Buffett was hooked and may have launched a similar business himself. While the total number of coin-operated scale machines he acquired and deployed (or thought about it) is unknown, he told HBO, “I had everybody in the country weighing themselves ten times a day and me just sitting there like the John D. Rockafeller of weighing machines.”

## Four takeaways for entrepreneurs

This story reveals four business principles that reverberate throughout Buffett’s career that you can apply to your own financial path today

### 1. Learn to do the math to figure out how a business will pay for itself.
Warren Buffett was a voracious bookworm. His dad was a stock salesman. His favorite book growing up was The World Almanac. He has a talent for remembering obscure numbers (like the population of Omaha in 1930). Buffett has said before that he just sits in his office and reads.

**The point is this:** Buffett does the work to gather the information he needs to calculate a business’s return so that a venture’s risk is less risky. He is famous for saying, “Risk comes from not knowing what you’re doing.”

### 2. The point is this: Buffett does the work to gather the information he needs to calculate a business’s return so that a venture’s risk is less risky. He is famous for saying, “Risk comes from not knowing what you’re doing.”

Warren Buffett is well known for his affirmation of compound interest in investing, but this story accentuates the power of compounding in a more tangible way. The more coin-operated scales he buys, the more income he makes. The more income he makes, the more scales he can buy, unlocking more income, more scales, and so on — this is the power of compounding.

### 3. Enter a market that is enormous.

The products and companies Buffett buys and sells are used by almost everyone. Look at the companies in his holding company — Berkshire Hathaway is essentially a portfolio of companies that have enormous markets: ice cream, real estate, insurance, candy, jewelry, paint, news media, cutlery, bricks, condiments. He sells what millions of people want. Several of these industries are approaching a trillion dollars.

### 4. Start a business that doesn’t require time to manage.

Buffett multiplies his income by investing his money instead of his time. He acquires assets that produce income without requiring his direct involvement. While his coin-operated scales machines are making money, young Warren Buffett used his time to work on his next enterprise, including a number of side hustles that made him $53,000 as a teenager.

One Thousand Ways is a dense read, but it’s not hard to imagine how it galvanized Buffett’s young “Fireball” mind to enter the business world and rise to the top.

I’ll leave you with perhaps the most important lesson of the book — one that is palpably manifested in Warren Buffett’s career — can be summarized in a strong statement from page 14:

# > “You will find one thing true of every story in this book. Each person began making money when he or she started. Had these people not come to a decision, and started a business of their own, they would never have made any money. Their success began with their decision to start — and so will yours.”
