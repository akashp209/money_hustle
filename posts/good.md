###### 2 reasons why you may be missing out on all the fun

I went longboarding for the first time in months this morning. I visited the bay marina, where the water is so still in the morning it looks like an ice skating rink.

I started slow, cruising by joggers and dogwalkers. I went all around like that, warming up while the cool wind hit my face. Then, I stopped.

I popped in my earphones, started playing Future Nostalgia, a pop/disco album by Dua Lipa that makes you want to dance. I started gliding, skating so fast and smoothly I felt like I was flying.

There was a puddle right in the middle of the walkway, and instead of going around, I went right through the middle. Water slashed on the board, my shoe, and my leg, but all I could do was laugh because there was great music in my ears, the wind was nice and crisp, and I was having fun.

I was so present in that moment nothing could destroy it... except when I almost fell, but that’s not the point. The point is this: there’s a lot more good in life than you think, and the main reason you miss those beautiful bits is that mentally, you’re somewhere else.

## What’s Greatness and Where Do You Find It?

It’s easy to get caught up in the parts that make our lives shit. All we see is ugliness. The financial struggles. The fights. The lack. I’m not saying your problems or feelings are invalid, but we can’t deny that we forget to acknowledge that there’s a lot of good in our lives.

Some people think they need to be rich and have more time to find that good. That they need to travel the world and skydive. Obviously, those are ideal and epic, but there’s a lot of greatness you’re missing in the ordinary moments.

_## You don’t need anything special to feel alive . To feel good.##_

A game of soccer with your family, a picnic in the backyard with your daughter, a karaoke party with just you and your partner — these simple moments become the memories you think back to with a smile. The ones that warm your heart. Not just the time you went to Disneyland or took a trip across the country, but the small things that happen in your own home.

As Kurt Vonnegut said:

> _# “Enjoy the little things in life because one day you`ll look back and realize they were the big things.”_

Of course, no moment will matter if you’re not mentally there. The most important thing you can do is be present because when you’re there you don’t miss a thing.

# Two Reasons Why You Might Struggling to Be Present

## 1. You’re on your phone
Admittedly, I uploaded an Instagram story when I started skating in the morning, but then I put my phone in my pocket and didn’t take it out for the remainder of the time. There was no reason. No need to kill my mood. No need to see what my friend’s pictures were capturing on Instagram.

Everything you need is in front of you, and you’re missing it because you’re staring at your phone. Think about how crazy that is.

We’re addicted to our phones, notifications, and social media. We know this. So start fighting it.

It’s as simple as locking your phone and putting it down. When you’re eating dinner with your family, ban the phone from the table. When you’re in the middle of a conversation, a game, any moment, resist the urge to pick it up.

The tweets aren’t as important and what’s happening in front of your eyes.


## 2. You’re worrying and stressing over work

Last night, in the middle of a game of gin with my sister, I realized that I’d forgotten to write an article. Just a few months ago, I would’ve told her that we had to stop because I had to work — even though it was already nine at night.

This time, I thought, “Will my writing career end if I don’t write tonight?” The answer was no, so I kept playing.

Instead of worrying and stressing like usual, I decided that I would be there with her, even if we played for a few hours — which we did. We listened to music and we laughed and she danced terribly, and it was a good time.

Our minds are constantly tangled in deadlines and goals. But your work? It can wait. You can pause for a few hours. You can take the rest of the day off. The world won’t end. People won’t forget you. You’ll still have a job in the morning.

It’s not worth the stress. Lose yourself when you’re with your friends and family, or while you’re working on your hobby, and you’ll discover that you’ll never regret that time.

## Final Words

The good, the fun, the stuff that makes you feel alive is in the everyday moments you experience. All you have to do is pay attention.

I’ll never forget the time I was visiting an aunt and uncle’s house with a bunch of family members last year. Everyone was talking and hanging out, and I was on the kitchen table, struggling to write and edit because I’d promised I’d publish every day for the month.

Work felt so important, but after, all I could think was, “What was the point?” There wasn’t one. Nothing bad would’ve happened if I’d taken the day off.

We always freak out about things that could easily be solved. You’re allowed a laugh, an hour off to read, some time with your family. Because there’s so much shit in the world, so much we can’t control, and we need it.

Take your head out of the water and take a deep breath. Don’t let yourself drown when you’re so much closer to the top than you think.
